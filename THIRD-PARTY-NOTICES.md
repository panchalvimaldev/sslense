## Notes

- **Microsoft.Web.Administration** is distributed by Microsoft under its proprietary .NET Library license, not an open-source license. The license link in the package metadata no longer resolves, so its exact current terms have not been re-verified for this release. It is redistributed unmodified as part of SSLense, as other open-source IIS tools do. It is the only component not under an OSI-approved license.
- **WiX Toolset** builds the MSI. Its build tools are used under the WiX Open Source Maintenance Fee EULA; the custom-action code embedded in the MSI is licensed under the Microsoft Reciprocal License (MS-RL), and its source is available from the WiX project.
- Test-only dependencies (xUnit, Moq, Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk) are not distributed.
